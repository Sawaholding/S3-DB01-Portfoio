# Introduction:
 <p>
According to oxford dictionary the term itself contains layers and layers of description. Culture is wide multi aspect construct, that is layered and widened up and narrowed down like the layers of an onion.
When browsing the results coming when searching the original definition of what is culture, the first observation is how many distinguished types of cultures there are.
Work culture, communication culture, religious culture of a certain group, national culture, family culture and so on and so on.
 </p>
 <p>
The different aspects of culture only show one dimension of the construct, as the reality is that for each distinguished type of culture many subcultures branching out of it.
For example when talking about working culture, we can compare flat or hierarchical way of management, how ever that does not include the devotion to work culture aspect neither the equality or the money transparency aspects.
In the previous example I only diverted from one major aspect of culture to some of the subcultures that could come out of it, however a really important adding is that it does not include the level of it, e.g. there are country working culture, company, mangers, workers, and all the micro unique special cases cultures.

# Culture differences: 
<p>
I have come from and eastern culture (Syria) and have lived Dubai, Turkey, and lastly the Netehrlands. I have always loved to work with other cultures and learn how to emphasis with others. I have studied one-year European studies at HBO Zuid in maastricht which taught me a lot about culture differences.
Culture differences can vary from communication to moral and ethical aspects.
 </p>
each group collective behavior can turn into culture difference, e.g. the most bazar one is how intense the difference in communication between the political studies and the ICT study. The political studies way of communication is based on win or lose, with high emphasis on who own the negotiation (“even that sometimes it was just a discussion it turned to be a bargaining somehow”), however the communication with ICT students is more collaborative and focus more on filling the gaps and utilizing the individual talents in the group to optimize for a win/win situation.

Culture differences can vary from two countries cultures to two communities or schools, tow neighborhoods, and sometimes two neighbors where each has a different family culture.
## My culture:
<p>
I have thrived and I hope that I will continue to thrive of collecting many small fragments of different cultures within me. 
I consider my self an inbetweener that can bridge some aspects of the Levant in the east with some of the west of Europe, adding to that, I have spent ten years changing countries since the war of syria started, which mostly I have spent within expats communities, which by itself is a global/diverse/rich/colorful culture that I belong partially to as well.
</p>


## Communications with respect to cultural differences in the group: 


<p>
I found it really important to set from the beginning a list of expectation, so I have asked to have a meeting where each one of us declared his expectation of how much effort/communication/semester-grade is expecting. After that I have made sure that I communicate personally with each one individually, which gave the time and the opportunity to create a common understanding of the person, chosen terms and vocabulary and the level of directness. After that I have made sure that when I can I will try to highlight the understanding that anyone can object and that we will only move forward within reasonable unanimous agreement.

# The ethics of the software development:
<p>
introduction: with more and more awareness about the enormous impact that software has on our lives, the topic to consider the moralities of our applications and the applications tactics is rising up and becoming a more needed consideration by the day.
In the last 20 years companies like Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, have been able to shape our world, many(including myself) will say not to the better but to the worse.
</p>

<p>
When software companies start to use the freedom of speech and exploit it with freedom or reach, we are never more exposed for foes more acknowledged and aware of our weaknesses than ever before, and reaching us inside our safe low guarded homes.
Not only private data companies are the threats, many shouts are calling for how easy it is for a handful of software engineers to switch governmental traffic sensors into monitoring surveillance agents.
</p>
The cases to prove the need to consider the morality and ethics of software development are endless and for the near future might(unfortunately) only to increase.


# Ethical aspects in my work:
The ethical considerations related to the projects I am helping developing needs to stretch for what beyond the right now level of development, as it is too easy to overstep some consideration if it was not made out of clear rules, (black and white) type of rules.
For the GP development we are working with PO that has its own agenda, like profit as a driving force for example. That could lead for the PO to ask for cross selling or up selling technics, through software solutions, an unethical approach will lead for increase in the consumerism behavior of the user without any consideration for sustainability for example and the balance between booth is not an easy task.
For my IP project I am developing a marketing/management system that aims to help small-medium business to compete with the giants monopolies of the market. 
However to be able to compete with the monopolies of the market I might need to use some of their tactics. 
Here come the question, when is it okay to use a gun(when the user consider it righteous aim to use it).
For example, when is it okay to use marketing strategies that increase consumerism aiming to switch costumers from Amazon to local business? 
I find the need to develop an ethical guideline and consideration is essential like never before at the moment, I enjoyed working and reading from TICT, sapiens and daytimes, the many articles related to the potential power of AI.
