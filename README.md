<details><summary>LO 6- Requirements and Design – GP</summary>
<p>

For the requirement and design, I started with Borga with library research and SOWT analysis that we included in the project plan, after that I went into the FoodHalen Amsterdam where they were using a similar system to the one asked by the PO and did field research.
 </p> 
 <p> 
I have asked some of the selling points in the Halen and the cashier and waiters about their experience with their system, after that, I have shared my findings with the team and together created a proposal design for the PO.
   </p>
   <p>
As we are working with scrum, the sprint review with PO always corrected and updated the acceptance criteria, that we iterated over our design sometimes and communicated with the PO through the email by the contact person Chandler during the sprints to check if our criteria is desirable by the PO.
